        let onboardingViewController = OnboardViewController(pageItems: [pageOne, pageTwo, pageThree])
        
        //finally we present the view controller
        onboardingViewController.presentFrom(self, animated: true)
    }
    
////VERY IMPORTANT NOTES
//   - you must embed your view controller into a NavigationController on the storyboard otherwise you won't see the pages
    
//   - the images if they are too big, they will look weird. I found around 256/256 sizes to work okay but you will need to experiment with it. Just drag and drop your images into the Assets.xcassets folder
    
//   - make sure that your podfile has a line that says "platform :ios, '11.0'" instead of the default 9.0
